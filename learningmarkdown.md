# Intro to Markdown

As I'm writing this article, I'm on day 1 of learning to code with Code Fellows (I've been generous, earlier referring to myself as a newbie coder... it's more like an absolute novice). But I actually find it amusing, knowing I'll read this article back one day and get a good chuckle at my humble beginnings. I've spent most of this Saturday afternoon watching recorded lectures, skipping around from one YouTube tutorial clip to the next, and scouring the internet to understand what GitHub is and how I don't accidentally break my first repository.

At this point, I feel like a preschooler who has memorized the ABCs of GitHub. Now I've got a big marker in one hand and a pile of construction paper in another, and I'm eager to string those letters together into something meaningful such as basic words or phrases. And I don't want to just put letters on a page: I want to make the words that I'm writing look pretty (granted, by my preschool-level standards of what pretty is). **With Markdown, I can decide what those marker lines on the construction paper look like / how the information on my web page shows up.** This includes:

### ***1. How big I want my words to be.*** 

I can make headings by adding number signs. One number sign will make it the biggest possible, all the way down to six number signs for the smallest. For example:

# Largest Heading Name Here
is written as
`# Largest Heading Name Here`

### Medium Heading Name Here
is written as
`### Medium Heading Name Here`

###### Smallest Heading Name Here
is written as
`###### Smallest Heading Name Here`

### ***2. If they should be with thicker or thinner lines, and if they should be slanted***

I can bold my text and italicize it with asterisks. Two asterisks on each side bold the text, and a single asterisk on each side italicizes them. If you want it to be both bolded and italicized, use three asterisks. For example:

**The text is bold**

is written as
`**The text is bold`

*The text is italicized*

is written as
`*The text is italicized*`

***The text is bold and italicized***

is written as
`***The text is bold and italicized***`

### ***3. If I want to cross out words***

I can cross out words / strikethrough by using the tilde symbol. For example:

~~I want to cross this out~~

is written as
`~~I want to cross this out~~`


And while this is just a glimpse into what Markdown can do to enhance the aesthetic of our webpages, it's been a fun start for me.
