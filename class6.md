## **How Computers Work**

1. What makes a computer a computer
- Four things common to all computers: input, storage, processing, and output (they take in information, store it as data, process it, then output the results)
- Input is what you put into the computer
- Input gives a computer information, which is then stored in memory
- A computer's processor takes information from memory, processes it using a series of commands, then sends it back to memory again - repeating until information is ready to be output
- A computer outputs information based on what it's designed to do

2. How information is represented using electricity
- Inside a computer are electric wires and circuits that carry all the information in a computer
- With electricity in a wire, the signal could either be on or off - 0 or 1 - constituting a bit, the smallest piece of information a computer can store
- More wires = more bits
- More bits = more complex information
- The binary number system = comprised of two digits (0 and 1), can be used  to create any number
- In binary, there's the 1s position, the 2s position, the 4s position, the 8s position, and so on. ex: 9 = 1001 ((1x8)+(0x4)+(0x2)+(1x1))
- With 32 wires, you can store all the way from 0 to 4 billion
- Text, images, and sound all come down to binary

3. How computers use circuits
- Circuitry can be an art form / a creative outlet
- Every input or output from a computer is a type of information which can be represented by on or off electrical signals (1s and 0s)
- In order to process the information as input and to make the information that is output, a computer needs to modify and combine the input signals
- To do this, a computer uses millions of teeny electric components, which come together to form circuits

4. The 4 parts of a computer
- Input devices converts physical input to binary information
- Memory stores information
- Central Processing Unit (CPU) calculates information
- Output devices converts information to physical output 

5. Software controls Hardware
- The hardware is all the physical devices you see, such as circuits, chips, and wires
- The software is all the computer programs (aka code) running on the machine
- The CPU is the master chip that controls all the other parts of the computer
- The CPU has smaller parts within it to handle certain tasks
- The Operating System is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer


## **JavaScript Intro**

### **What is JavaScript**

- JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions
- It's known as the scripting language for Web pages, but many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js and Apache CouchDB

### **What are Variables?**

- Variables are containers for storing data
- Declare your JavaScript variables with `let` or `const` (`var` is considered outdated, as it was used from 1995 - 2015)
- If the variable can change, use `let`; if it doesn't, use `const`
- Constant values cannot be changed; let variables can be
- Like algebra, variables are used in expressions
All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names

`=` is an "assignment" operator, not an "equal to" operator
- "equal to" operator is written as `==` in JavaScript
- It's a best practice to declare all variables at the beginning of a script
