## **What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team**

- There's a persistent interest among various entities, such as businesses and elite academic institutions, to figure out how to build the "perfect team"
- A common belief was in bringing homogenous people together: similar levels of intelligence, though patterns, motives, etc., such as the example in the article about Rozovsky and her study group at Yale
- Rozovsky didn't feel connected to this group: they'd do the work then go, there was a competitive feel to most of their interactions, and she didn't feel inspired / the environment didn't foster innovation
- She joined another group; one comprised of people with a variety of backgrounds and life experiences
- This second group formed more creative ideas and formed a stronger and more trusting rapport, "we all felt like we could say anything to each other... No one worried that the rest of the team was judging them"
- Data is giving us a better understanding of personal productivity
- A movement to go beyond focusing on employee optimization and understanding how people work together
- Google is one of the most public proselytizers of how studying workers can transform productivity: developed a fixation for building the perfect team
- Google thought the key was to group the best people together
- Shifted their research to looking at the "unwritten rule" of groups / the "team's culture"
- Key takeaways: equal distribution of conversational turn-talking (translated to a better distribution of the work load), and average social sensitivity / skilled at reading each other's nonverbal cues
- Serious vs. free flowing -- free flowing more successful
