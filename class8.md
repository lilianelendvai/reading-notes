# Class 8 Reading Notes

## **Operators and Expressions**

### **Operators**

- JavaScript has several types of operators, including: Assignment operators, Comparison operators, Arithmetic operators, Bitwise operators, Logical operators, String operators, Conditional (ternary) operators, Comma operators, Unary operators, Relational operators
- The precedence of operators determines the order they are applied when evaluating an expression; one can override operator precendence with parentheses

### **Expressions**

- An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value
- Every syntactically valid expression resolves to some value; conceptually, there are two types of expressions: with side effects and those that evaluate in some sense and therefore resolve to a value
- JavaScript has these expression categories: Arithmetic (evaluates to a number), String (evaluates to a character string), Logical (evaluates to true or false), Primary expressions (basic keywords and general expressions in JavaScript), and Left-hand-side expressions (left values are the destination of an assignment)

## **Loops and Iteration**

- Loops are a fast and easy way to do something repeatedly
- Although there are many kinds of loops, they all repeat an action a number of times
- Various loop mechanics offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop
- The statement for loops in JavaScript are: for statement; do...while statement; while statement; labeled statement; break statement; continue statement; for...in statement; for...of statement
- A `four` loop repeats until the specified condition evaluates to false
- A `do...while` statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false
- A `while` statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to `true`
- A `label` provides the statement an identifier which lets you refer to it elsewhere in your program
- A `break` statement is used to terminate a loop, switch, or in conjunction with a labeled statement
- A `continue` statement can be used to restart a while, do-while, for, or label statement
- A `for...in` statement reiterates a specified variable over all the enumerable properties of an object
- A `for...of` statement creates a loop iterating over iterable objects
