# Class 7 Reading Notes

## **Control Flow**

- The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script
- Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line unless the computer encounters structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals or loops
- A typical script in JavaScript of PHP includes many control structures, such as conditionals, loops, and functions
- With control flow when reading a script, one must read from start to finish and look at the programming structure to see how it affects the order of execution 

## **JavaScript Functions**

- A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task, executed when something invokes it / calls it
- A JavaScript Function is defined with the `function` keyword, followd by a name, followed by parentheses
- Function names follow the same rules as variables = they can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
- The code to be executed by the function goes inside curly brackets
- Function parameters are listed inside parentheses in the function definition
- Function arguments are the values received by the function when invoked
- The arguments / the parameters behave as local variables inside the function
- The code in the function will execute when something invokes / calls the function
- When reaching a return statement, the function will stop executing
- Functions often compute a return value
- Functions allow you to reuse code (define the code once then use it many times) and you can use the same code many times with different arguments, producing different results
- Functions can be used the same way as variables in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations
- Variables declared within a JavaScript are local to the function (only accessible from within the function)



## **JavaScript Operators**

- Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic on numbers:
-  Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables
- The `+` and `+=` operators can also be used to add (concatenate) strings
- When used on strings, the `+` operator is called the concatenation operator
- Adding two numbers will return the sum, but adding a number and a string will return a string
- Bit operators work on 32 bits numbers
