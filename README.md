## My learning journal for code fellows!

Hello, and I'm Liliane Lendvai (she/her). Thank you for visiting my Reading Notes page for the Code Fellows 102 course. I live in the PNW / greater Seattle area, and as a former Californian, I'm in awe of all the greenery up this way and not being in a constant drought. I'm a former music instructor, a current executive recruiter, and a newbie coder!
