## My learning journal for code fellows!

Hello, and I'm Liliane Lendvai. Thank you for visiting my Reading Notes page for the Code Fellows 102 course. I live in the PNW / greater Seattle area, and as a former Californian, I'm constantly in awe of all the greenery up this way and not being in a constant drought. I'm a former music instructor, a current executive recruiter, and a newbie coder!

## Learning about bravery from a 10-year-old: what it means to have a Growth Mindset

> **Ms. Lili, I don't think I should stay in band. I haven't been able to make a sound, and I'm really trying. I just can't get it.**

It's been about two weeks since Julie, along with twelve other 6th graders, started learning their new instrument: the flute. Most of the kids have made admittedly out of pitch but clearly audible notes, pressing the keys with as much force as they could muster from their fingers and making themselves dizzy, rapidly pushing all of the air from their little lungs into their instruments. There's a euphoria that comes from making that first squeak: an initial validation that you've got the goods to learn music. But that moment hadn't come yet for Julie.

As she came to me after class, with tears welling up and her voice quivering in disappointment, I saw myself in her. *When you're ten, and all your friends seem to have been gifted the musical gene but not you, giving up's an appealing option.* ***Especially when you're a middle schooler and one of your biggest fears is public humiliation and failure.*** But I knew what music did for me at this age, and I tried to think of what I needed to hear when I was in her position:

> Julie, I'm so proud of you for trying, and I'm sorry it's been hard to make that initial sound. As your teacher, you see that the flute is pretty easy for me now, but did you know that I was just like you before? I was the last one in my class to make a sound, and I was embarrassed about it. But I didn't give up, and because I worked hard, I got much better. And now I get to teach all of you, so that's pretty cool! If I can do it, then I know you can, too. Maybe you'll become a teacher someday, too, and you can play all the fun pieces of music that you want. Is there something you want to play, once you learn?

I hoped the redirection / attempt at Jedi mind tricks like my mother did on me as a kid would work now. After a brief silence, she replied:

> I like the theme song from The Little Mermaid.

> Oooh, I like that one, too. Let's make sure that you learn that soon, okay?

> Okay.

Just from saying "okay," from giving herself permission to push on a little longer, Julie was brave, and it paid off. After trying several techniques and getting creative with how we approached it, Julie got that first note out. And over the next couple years as my student, I got to see her struggle pay off as she played all sorts of songs, with The Little Mermaid remaining one of her favorites.

### Now that I'm starting with coding, I feel like Julie / like my 10-year-old self again sitting in band, trying to make that first sound... and intimidated by what's ahead. 

I signed up for this, and I know I want to do this, but I don't quite know how. Terms and symbols and techniques are all above my head at this point, and a little insecure voice in my head makes me question if I can.

But when I hear that voice, I think of Julie and how proud I was of her for developing a **growth mindset, the perspective and belief that she could learn something new, and that the potential for growth and improvement wasn't fixed. With a growth mindset, I can find the strength within myself to persevere, especially when confronted with new and challenging concepts.**

Some ways I can practice a growth mindset:
- Imagine what I want my future to look like, and believe that I have the power and abilities within myself to make it happen.
- Celebrate the little wins, such as learning a simple concept or completing one assignment.
- Treat myself like I'm that capable yet impressionable 6th grader: with compassion, with patience, and with encouragement.

***If Julie could be brave and make that first squeak on her flute, then I can be brave and take these first steps with coding.***
