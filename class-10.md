# 201 Course: Class 6 Reading Notes

Why these topics matter: It's important we learn how to identify errors in our code and ways that we can address them. It will be a constant part of our careers, dealing with these situations and finding ways to resolve them.

## **What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.**

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

- Syntax errors are when there are spelling errors in the code that cause the program to stop part way through or not run at all
- Logic errors are when the syntax is correct and the program runs, but it gives incorrect results; typically harder to fix than syntax errors, as there usually isn't an error message directing you to the source of the error

2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

- I've had both syntax and logic errors in past lab assignments. I've dealt with them by testing different parts of the code to hopefully to identify and then isolate the problemmatic areas. I check that the syntax is correct, and if it is, I look for flaws in the logic. If I'm stumped, I'll google what it is I'm encountering and how to fix it, or I'll ask someone for help.

3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?

- As a programmer, I'll be constantly facing errors, so it's important I know how to identify them and the appropriate methods to resolve them.

## **The JavaScript Debugger**

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

- The debugger allows you to watch the values of variables and set breakpoints, make places in the code you want to pause execution of, and identify the problems preventing your code from executing properly.

2. Define what a breakpoint is.

- In a program, a breakpoint is an intentional stopping or pausing place
- Made for debugging purposes

3. What is the call stack?

- The call stack section shows what code was executed to get the current line
